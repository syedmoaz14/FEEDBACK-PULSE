# üõçÔ∏è FeedbackPulse AI: E-commerce Review Analyst

## Project Overview

This project, **FeedbackPulse AI**, leverages **Generative AI (Gemini LLM)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to transform raw, unstructured customer reviews into structured, actionable business intelligence.

It addresses the critical business need of rapidly processing large volumes of customer feedback to inform product development, marketing, and support prioritization.

### Key Features:

* **Generative Analysis:** Uses the Gemini LLM to automatically generate three structured insights for every review:
    1.  **Sentiment:** (Positive, Negative, Neutral)
    2.  **Topic Tagging:** (e.g., `Sizing_Fit`, `Quality`, `Shipping_Delivery`)
    3.  **Action Item:** A concise, direct suggestion for the business.
* **Interactive Dashboard (Streamlit):** Presents the analysis with real-time charts and filters for quick decision-making.
* **Python Stack:** Built using **Python**, **Pandas**, **Streamlit**, and the **Google GenAI SDK**.

## Project Files

| File | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `streamlit_app.py` | The main file that runs the interactive web dashboard. |
| `main.py` | The pipeline script that calls the LLM for batch analysis and creates the final CSV. |
| `llm_analyzer.py` | Contains the core Generative AI logic, JSON Schema, and prompt engineering. |
| `data_utils.py` | Handles data loading, cleaning, and sampling of raw reviews. |
| `master_analysis_data.csv` | **(Generated by `main.py`)** The final dataset containing all LLM-generated insights. |
| `requirements.txt` | Lists all necessary Python dependencies. |

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* A **Gemini API Key** (obtainable from [Google AI Studio URL]).

### 2. Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/syedmoaz14/FEEDBACK-PULSE.git
    cd FEEDBACK-PULSE
    ```
2.  **Create and Activate Virtual Environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
    .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
    ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### 3. API Key Configuration

The project requires the `GEMINI_API_KEY` to be set as an environment variable.

* **Local Run:** Set the environment variable in your terminal before running the pipeline, or configure it directly in your PyCharm Run Configurations (recommended).
    ```bash
    export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_KEY_HERE"
    ```

### 4. Run the Analysis Pipeline (One-Time Step)

The `main.py` script performs the costly LLM calls and saves the results.

```bash
python main.py
